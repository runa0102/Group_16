# How Text Classification can contribute to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals

The text classification approach used in this project—where an LLM (Large Language Model) classifies movie genres based on textual summaries—has broader applications beyond entertainment and can even contribute to some of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

	1. One area where this approach can help is Quality Education (SDG 4). Automated classification can make it easier to organize and recommend educational materials, helping students and teachers find relevant content. By applying similar AI techniques, learning platforms can personalize study materials based on student needs, making education more accessible and efficient.
 
	2. Another important impact is on Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9). The same AI-driven classification methods used for movies can also be applied to other fields, such as legal or medical documents, making information easier to categorize and retrieve. This can improve efficiency in digital platforms and create smarter systems for organizing large amounts of data.

While this project focuses on classifying movie genres, the same approach could be used in many other areas to make information more accessible, organized, and inclusive.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40d676de-2e6b-4f97-a3eb-517db1c5fb9a)
